In addition to completing required readings, students are expected to undertake a project that analyzes the role of Joint Fact Finding in the Cape Wind controversy. The projects could take the form of individual research papers or a role-play simulation developed by the class as a team that introduces participants in the Cape Wind controversy to the concept of Joint Fact Finding.

Examples of student papers are listed in the table below.
